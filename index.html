    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>The second major cause of women's death is breast cancer (after lung cancer) [1]. 246,660 of women's new cases of
      invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in the US during 2016 and 40,450 of women’s death is estimated
      [2]. Breast cancer represents about 12% of all new cancer cases and 25% of all cancers in women [3]. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, advancements in machine learning have simplified the process of cancer identification,
      enabling doctors to make a diagnosis before the onset of common symptoms [2]. As more sophisticated tools are
      developed, the diagnosis of breast cancer can be estimated with high accuracy [3]. A tool-based diagnosis of
      malignant breast cancer cells can allow doctors to make a more accurate diagnosis of the patients based on the
      tissue cells. This reduces both the cost of such medical tests error rate in identifying breast cancer in
      patients. This ultimately saves more lives.</p>
    <p>Therefore in this project, we aim to use a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning to weigh different
      features of a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass, which describe characteristics of
      the cell nuclei present in the image, in order to accurately predict if the cell is indeed malignant. This
      eventually assist doctors in the diagnosis of breast cancer in patients. Ultimately, we hope to use the fitted
      model as baseline diagnostic tools for patients. The analysis below outlines each of the methods used, leading up
      to our final recommendations.</p>
    <h4>Dataset</h4>
    <p>The UCI Breast Cancer Dataset [5] is a public data set that has its features computed from a digitized image of a breast mass. This data set covers the relationship between the malignancy of a cancer cell and its physical properties. The dataset consists of 10 features, 1 binary label, and 569 training examples.</p>
    <p>Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus taken from the breast tissue:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
      <li>radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)</li>
      <li>texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)</li>
      <li>perimeter</li>
      <li>area</li>
      <li>smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)</li>
      <li>compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)</li>
      <li>concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)</li>
      <li>concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)</li>
      <li>symmetry</li>
      <li>fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)</li>

        </ul>
